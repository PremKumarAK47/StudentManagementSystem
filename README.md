# StudentManagementSystem 
## Here is all about this Student Management System 
This is a Console Based Project in which I have used Java, JDBC and DAO pattern to create this.
## Features -:

**1. Register The Student:** Allows you to register a new student by providing their details such as roll number, name, marks, email, and password.

**2. Login Student:** Enables a student to log in by entering their roll number and password.

**3. Get Student By Roll Number:** Retrieves and displays the details of a student based on their roll number.

**4. Update Marks Of a Student:** Allows you to update the marks of a student by providing their roll number.

**5. Delete The Student Details:** Deletes the details of a student based on their roll number.

**6. Get All Student Details:** Retrieves and displays the details of all the students in the system.

**7. Register A Course:** Registers a new course by providing the course details.

**8. Register a Student into a Course:** Enrolls a student into a specific course by providing their roll number and the course details.

**9. Get Student's Course Details:** Retrieves and displays the course details of a student based on their roll number.

**10 .Exit:** Exits the Student Management System.

## Tech Stack
The Student Management System is developed using the following technologies:

- Java: The core programming language used for implementing the system.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): A Java API used for connecting to and interacting with a MySQL database.
- MySQL: A popular relational database management system used to store and retrieve student and course data.
- DAO Pattern (Data Access Object): A design pattern used to separate the data access logic from the business logic of the application, providing a more modular and maintainable code structure.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository or download the source code files.

- Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

- Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the application.

- Build and run the application.

- The application will display a menu with options for each feature. Enter the corresponding number to execute a specific feature.

- Follow the prompts and input the required information to perform the desired action.

- Repeat steps 5-6 to perform additional actions or choose the "Exit" option to quit the application.

- Please note that you might need to modify the code and configuration to suit your specific environment and database setup.
